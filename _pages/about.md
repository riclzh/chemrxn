About
---
This group is led by Dr. Richmond Lee, a synthetic/computational chemist and currently a Vice Chancellor's Research Fellow at the [University of Wollongong](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/richmond_lee). Richmond completed his PhD at the Australian National University under [Prof. Michelle Coote](https://rsc.anu.edu.au/~mcoote/). After his PhD, he embarked on a three-year independent fellowship at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. In 2020, he relocated to the University of Wollongong.

Research focus
---
* Employ computational chemistry to study catalytic processes, intersecting organic, organometallics and physical organic chemistry, and to gain insights into reaction mechanisms, and knowledge crucial to build reliable predictions to understand chemical reactivity that aid in development or discovery of new reactivity or reaction. 
* Establish combined theory-experimental efforts to link key mechanistic insights to chemical reactivity and allowing this new knowledge to improve overall understanding of the catalytic system through rational computational chemical design.
